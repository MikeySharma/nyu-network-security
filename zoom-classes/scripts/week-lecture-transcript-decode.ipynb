      "[\"Hello! Welcome to Cs. 6,823 network security. My name is Professor Philip Mack. Today is Monday, March 31, st 2025. And this is week number 9 for network security. Today, we're talking about\", 'message security. Pki and Tls, part 2', 'logistics. First, st Lab 3 has been released. Lab 3 is due next Sunday on April 6th next Sunday, I believe.', \"Lab 3 is an auto graded lab, and there's also a 5% bonus points for submitting it 5 days early as well. So if you can submit it by April.\", \"April first, st you can get a 5 percentage points added just the top of your grade. Please note that the early submission bonus is manual has to be manually added in. So if you, whatever points you get, that's the points that you got without the\", \"early bonus or the late deduction. So please go ahead and start Lab 3. If you haven't yet. If you need more information about what you need to do for Lab 3. Please watch last week's video week number 8, and the 1st hour goes over what you need to do for Lab number 3.\", 'Also, homework number 3 has been released. Homework number 3 is on inspecting a Tls session.', \"and this we haven't discussed it yet. We'll discuss it next week. So I released it today. But\", \"don't expect us to know to get the information how to do it until next week. So please go ahead and just take a look at it. And if you don't understand lab homework number 3, that's okay. We'll go over the materials next week, and then, after next week, you should have a full understanding of what you need to do for homework number 3, and we'll go through demonstrations and what you need to do for homework number 3. So that's next week. But if you want to get started early on that, I've already released it as well.\", 'So today we are continuing our discussion on message integrity, Pki and Tos.', 'And the reason that we want to talk about this is to go and explain.', 'How does Tls work on the Internet?', 'And more specifically.', 'how are you able to go to amazon.com and go buy something, enter your credit card number and have that be secure.', \"Well, it's very straightforward. We'll go over today. How it uses Aes Rsa hashing algorithms in order to ensure the protection of your encrypted messages on the Internet.\", 'But see, the the thing is this same technology', 'use for protecting your credit card number when you go. Shopping', 'is the same technology used in top secret Dod military grade encryption.', 'So', 'we hear this term on TV shows a lot like, I always like my ears always pick up when I hear military grade encryption right? We hear that on TV all the time. Right, have you?', 'And well, I want to ask, what does that mean?', 'Like what is military grade encryption?', \"Well, it's exactly the same as a Tls connection.\", \"It's a combination of using Aes Rsa\", 'or one of the post-quantum computing equivalents and some hashing algorithm.', \"That's it.\", 'It uses the exact same protocols', 'to encrypt your credit card number all the way up to top secret information using Nsa certified radios.', \"It's the same technology, it's the same algorithms. It's the same protocols.\", 'So this really shows how important that these encryption algorithms are.', 'and Pki public key infrastructure. You', 'have probably heard this Pki before in terms of asymmetric keys, or in terms of Cas. But really, Pki is an architecture.', 'And the real point of Pki is that different companies or different protocols can talk to each other in some sort of', 'manner that everyone understands.', \"So, for example, let's say you go and take outlook.\", \"If you use Microsoft outlook, and you decide to send an encrypted message to let's say, Mozilla Thunderbird.\", 'you are able to send a encrypted message between Outlook and Thunderbird.', \"Why? Because they're using some standard in the way they perform their encryption like there are a lot of ways to do it. But Pki is kind of well, standard is the wrong word, but maybe architecture is a better word. It gives some sort of framework, so that these different companies can talk to each other. And Pki includes all the things that's listed on this chart which will go through some of these together today.\", '1st of all, what is a digital signature?', 'A digital signature? We started discussing this last week. A digital signature is the hash of a message', 'encrypted using the private key.', 'So digital signature is a hash of a message', 'encrypted using the private key. So last week we talked about, we talked about Hmac and', \"digital signatures. Let's see, where's the slide here? Slide somewhere here. Okay, here. Digital signatures. Digital signatures is a hash message encrypted with Rsa private key, right? It doesn't have to be Rsa\", \"and Hmac is a hash of a message encrypted using a symmetric key. So digital signatures in Hmac are really similar. They essentially do the same thing. They're both secure. The only difference is\", 'once asymmetric keys, and one is a symmetric key. So let me just make it clear. One is asymmetric', 'and the other one uses a symmetric key.', \"So let's talk about how digital signatures work.\", 'So in order to perform an encryption in order to create a digital signature.', 'Yeah.', 'first, st you have to have some sort of message and let me get some. Let me just get something. So I could draw an infographic over here.', \"So let's say, here you have some sort of message.\", 'and you take this message.', 'and you need a hash of it. So you take this message and you create some sort of hash.', \"Let's pick sha-two 156. As that's a very common hashing protocol.\", 'So you take a 200 Shah, 256 of it.', 'and let me just change the color of this to something else.', 'After you take a shot, 256 of it. You encrypt the hash', 'using the Rsa private key. So this also means that', \"this user over here. Let's say it's Alice.\", 'Alice has an Rsa. Public key', \"and an Rsa. Private key, and they are, of course they are linked together. So there's a pair here. The Rsa. Public key and the Rsa. Private key.\", \"So Alice, let's say, takes the hash of this message.\", 'generates a Sha-two 156 hash, and then encrypts this hash, using her Rsa private key.', 'So that becomes a digital signature. So from there she gets a digital signature.', 'And let me just change the color of this, do something else.', 'And with this Alice goes and Set takes the message.', 'plus the digital signature of it', 'and sends it off to Bob, or something like that sends it off over to Bob.', 'Okay, so this is how a message with a digital signature works example, you send an email.', 'you send a signed email to one of your colleagues. For whatever reason, then.', \"this will be the exact process that's being used in email. The email gets a hash of it.\", 'And then, after the hash, it gets encrypted using the Rsa private key and it becomes a digital signature.', 'So a digital signature is essentially off', 'the message encrypted using the Rsa private key.', 'And it goes to Bob.', \"Let's say, Alice goes to Bob.\", 'Question question when Bob receives this message, how does Bob validate that? Did your signature?', 'How does Bob validate this digital signature?', \"How can Bob be sure that it was Alice that's sending the message?\", 'What does Bob need to do?', 'Bob will need to check the message by using the public key', \"by using Alice's public key. Yeah, that's right.\", \"What does Bob do with Alice's public key\", 'decrypts the digital signature.', \"So yeah, let's take a look at this.\", \"So Bob receives this message. So now, Bob, in Bob's inbox.\", 'Bob has this message and digital signature.', 'So then Bob needs to decrypt this digital signature.', 'So Bob takes his digital signature', \"and Bob goes and decrypts it, using using what decrypts using Alice's public key.\", \"And when you take the digital signature and you decrypt it, using ours's public key.\", 'what is the result that comes out of that.', \"you take this digital signature, you decrypt it, using Alison's public key.\", \"What's the result of this description?\", 'The hash? Yeah. You get the hash back.', 'So you get this hash.', \"You take the 2 signature, you decrypt it. Using Alice's public key.\", 'You get the hash done what', 'one of our colleagues just mentioned', 'hash the original message. Okay? So then you take this original message over here.', 'and then you do a hash of it.', 'And when you take a hash of it.', 'What do you get?', 'You get a sha-two 56 hash?', \"And then from there, yeah, Bob, we'll check that. These 2, our eco Bob validates that the 2 hashes\", 'are the same.', \"and if they're the same, that means the digital signature matches and it validates that. This means that wow!\", 'What does it mean?', 'So Bob goes and validates that these 2 hashes the same, she validates the digital signature.', 'And so once Bob validated, just enter.', \"What's the conclusion that he can make?\", 'Therefore, what, therefore, what does that mean?', 'It means, yeah, the message has not been tampered with.', 'Perfect, very good.', 'What else does that mean?', 'Specifically, I want to ask, who said.', 'Does Bob know who sent a message from this point', 'like who sent the message? Then?', 'So well, I know it might be tempting to say. Alice sent the message, but specifically, more more technically.', \"who sent the message? It's not Alice who sent the message which I guess we could say it's Alice who sent a message, but what it really means is, whoever has Alice's key sent the message.\", \"So actually, whoever had Alice's private key sent the message so\", \"well, we presume it's Alice, right? So\", \"so Alice is the one who has Alice's private key. So then Alice must have sent the message.\", 'Probably right? So I hope so.', 'I hope so.', \"So. Yeah, this is exactly how it works. So let's say you're sending an email right, Alice on the left side, Bob on the right side. Alice sends this message. It says, Hello! How are you? And then Alice will take a shot. 56 of it then\", 'encrypt the hash, using her private key. That is, a digital signature sends over to Bob. Bob, has this message in digital signature. Bob will do 2 things. Bob will hash the message.', 'and then Bob will decrypt the digital signature, and from there get a sha-two 156 hash compares the 2 hashes, and if the hashes are the same, that means that Alice sent a message, or', \"specifically, more specifically, whoever had Alice's private key which we hope is Alice is the one who sent the message. It also means that the message has not been tampered with that we know of.\", 'Now question, where does Bob?', \"So Bob is decrypting this digital signature, using Alice's public key, where does Bob get Alice's public key from?\", 'Where does Alice get the public key from', 'so they get it from the Ca, but technically, how like? So, yes.', 'public cert comes from the Ca, technically, how does Bob has his hands on it', 'like, where did Bob get the Rsa. Public key?', 'Where did he actually get it from?', 'How does he have it in his possession?', \"Yeah, he got it from Alice. So this one thing that's missing here that I did not share is that\", 'with this message the private key is also sent. Let me turn this to a different color.', 'So the Rsa public and private key', \"is actually sent along with the email when it's sending it along as well.\", 'This is common in all emails.', \"So this email comes with the Rsa public key along with the message. So when Alice is sending this message, the email over this message with the digit integer and the Rsa. Public key. It gets sent over to Bob. So Bob, when he receives this message, already, has the public key in order to validate. And let me just be very clear. This is Alice's\", 'Rsa. Public key.', 'So Bob has everything he needs to decrypt this message.', \"the message, the digital signature, and Alice's public key.\", \"Bob doesn't need to go out to get anything. Bob already has this information already.\", 'So therefore Bob can just decrypt everything just like that.', \"So question, let's say, Alice, excuse me.\", \"let's say, Trudy, an evil Trudy.\", \"in this case. Right evil, Trudy, evil. Trudy in this class. Trudy is always watching. Right? That's the way Trudy is always watching this conversation.\", 'So the thing is, if Trudy intercepts this conversation because Trudy is intercepting this conversation.', 'What can 3D. See?', 'What can truly see?', 'Can Trudy see the message in this case?', 'Yeah.', \"yeah, because it's not encrypted. So right now, all we really care about is message integrity, because digital signatures is used to validate the integrity of the message.\", \"And I'm just reading off one of our colleagues from the chat window. So thank you. Digital signatures is just to validate that the message.\", 'The integrity of the message is not to ensure confidentiality in any way.', \"So it's it's not meant to have confidentiality. And so Trudy can see everything here\", \"so Trudy, as we talked about many examples. Trudy can be this person in Starbucks. Trudy can be your hacked ISP. Trudy can be the corporate network, and she's inside the corporate network watching the traffic. Trudy can be a IoT device that got compromised.\", 'It truly can be anything. 2D. Can be sniffing the wireless transmissions over the air in the van outside your home.', 'Right? So anytime, we just presume that 2D can', 'can see the message at any time every time.', 'So yeah, is a digital signature. Digital signatures are for integrity', 'and for authenticity, not for confidentiality. So therefore, Trudy can see everything. But', 'even though Trudy can see everything.', \"we know that Trudy can't mollify the message.\", \"So that's that's acceptable in this case. If this is the goal here.\", 'But one big thing I want to point out here is that', 'the public key is sent along with the message.', 'the public key is sent along, but the message.', 'the public key is sent along with the message?', 'Question question.', 'So Bob got this public key from Alice via email, how does Bob know', \"that it's really Alice's public key?\", 'How does Bob know? Like. So Bob received this certificate.', \"this public key. But actually, I should use the correct terminology. It's it's a certificate, public\", \"public certificate. That's the correct terminology here. So let me just change this to the correct terminology.\", 'So Rsa is just one component of the search.', \"So how does how does Bob know that this is really Alice's certificate.\", 'Awesome.', 'Yeah, so does does Pop.', 'Actually, no?', 'Well, in this example, in this example, here.', 'they, this is an email certificate.', 'Right? This is an email certificate and email certificates.', \"They don't have a validation path to the Ca, meaning\", \"the email clients do not check with the Ca, whether it's a valid certificate or not.\", 'Email certificates do not get validated with the Ca, so actually.', 'Bob does not validate this whatsoever.', 'Bob does not validate it. So', 'now the question I am giving here is.', \"well, Trudy's here right? Trudy is not just passively watching.\", 'Trudy can can change things as well.', 'So what if Trudy goes and replaces', 'this whole message and digital signature and everything like that.', 'will it work or not?', 'So in email, there are, there are 2 things that are done to help protect against it.', \"Right? There's 2 things.\", 'The 1st thing 1st thing is the subject Ca, called the common name.', 'So when the public search. It has this thing called common name in it, and the common name is the binding to the subject.', \"So the subject here in this case would be Alice's\", \"email address, so it could be common name equals, let's say, alice@acme.com, or something like that.\", 'So a common name', 'is not the same as a canonical name. A common name is the what this certificate is binded to, so every certificate', 'is binded to something. That is what is this certificate for?', 'And so if Alice is sending an email.', \"then her certificate is binded to her email address, meaning it's her email certificate\", 'and therefore her public cert will have this information on it, saying, the common name', 'is alice@acme.com, or whatever it is.', 'So when Bob receives this email and receives his cert.', 'Bob would check whether the Cn. The common name is alice@acme.com before proceeding.', 'So Bob does some sort of validation here, just to make sure as well.', \"So that's the 1st thing that's being done.\", \"Now, if you think about this too much, you see that there's many ways.\", \"There's many ways to get around this.\", \"There's many ways to get around this\", \"right, because there's no like master list of of Cas when it comes to email.\", 'So because of that, email providers have a second', 'protection mechanism. And the second method is that you have to explicitly trust', 'the certificate. The 1st time that you see it so the 1st time.', \"So if this, if you're within your company, it doesn't matter. So if you work for Acme Corporation.\", \"This Fake Company Acme Corporation, and you are employees of Acme Corporation. Then it's automatically done for you. So you don't have to do anything. But let's say you're sending an email to someone else like to another company.\", 'And you send the email to this other company that you have no relationships with.', \"Then they don't know whether this is a real certificate or not, even though it's binded to your email.\", \"So usually, the 1st time you send an email to each other you like, call each other up and say, Hey, this is my email. It has my certificate on it. Why don't you save my certificate? So next time I can use my certificate to send your encrypted email.\", \"So that's the second way that\", 'these certificates are trusted or not. So the 2 ways.', \"So how does Bob trust that this is Alice's certificate?\", 'One Cn is binded to?', \"I think the correct term is subject is, bind it to Alice's email address. Right? That's 1,\", '2. Bob explicitly trusted this specific certificate.', 'And so how this works is, you send an email.', 'Alice sends an email to Bob, saying, Hi, Bob, this is Alice, and this is my certificate.', 'And then they call each other on the phone and say, Hey, I just sent you my certificate. And Bob says, Okay, then we just trust it and add it to my', 'my trust store.', 'And after that, next time he gets an email from Alice, and it checks her certificate.', 'The outlook client will check whether this specific certificate has been trusted.', 'And this is just for emails.', 'because the process for emails and websites are different.', 'The process for emails and websites are different.', \"And before I talk about that later today, we're going to talk about how website certificates work, and then we'll talk about. Then you'll see why email is so different from website certificates. The main difference overall\", \"is that just jumping ahead, that email certificates doesn't have a validation chain to to go back to the Ca, to ensure that this certificate is really the correct. Ca, it doesn't have any of that processes. So email is like wild Wild West in certificates.\", 'And therefore you need these 2 things. Specifically, this, the biggest thing is number 2, that is.', \"you have to explicitly trust that you are trusting this person's certificate, as in this certificate, has been marked as trusted by your client as it's added to your certificate store. Otherwise you can't really trust the email.\", 'Remember, Alice is in the middle.', 'Alice can replace everything with another certificate because certificates', 'are not as trusted as they are for websites.', 'So this is a digital signature. So we got off on a tangent here. But digital signatures, how do they work? Digital signatures is when you create a hash of a message and encrypt it. Using a private key, you send it over to your recipient, and the recipient would decrypt it', 'by checking the digital signature. Excuse me, or validate using the by decrypting digital signature, getting the hash, taking a hash of the message again, and then taking', 'and then comparing them. Still the certificate is received', 'from the sender. The sender sends a certificate to the recipient, because Bob has no way', 'to retrieve the certificate other than from', \"getting it from Alice, like there is no Ca, there is a Ca, but the Ca doesn't have a service where he can query the Ca\", 'and get the certificate.', \"And of course, I'm mentioning this because there are many misconceptions of how Cas work on the Internet like\", \"the Ca is a rolodex. I can just pull someone's certificate out does not exist anywhere. That concept does not exist. A Ca is not a directory service at all. You can't just pull someone's certificate out of a Ca, but\", 'if you work for a large company', 'and you have like active directory, or you use outlook, or you do something like that.', 'They populate the certificates into your directory already so you can pull it.', 'But', \"it's not a Ca feature. So you send an email to someone outside your company. And all those things doesn't work\", 'anymore.', 'So moving on this next slide about', 'digital signatures, this is the exact same thing, I explained in a different way, signature, verification. We went through this. So if you did not understand the previous explanation.', 'Aka, over here, please take a look at these slides that talk about it in a maybe a different way that could be understood differently.', 'So', 'now we want to move on and talk about what a. Ca is a Ca. Is authority', 'that can that can issue certificates.', \"It's just it's an authority that can issue certificates.\", 'And when someone gets a certificate they have to.', 'They have to go to a Ca.', 'and you have to get some sort of validation for it.', \"So, for example, let's say I want to get a certificate for my email.\", \"What I would do is I would go to a Ca, that's doing this, and then\", 'I will usually have to pay a fee or a small fee, or it could be free sometimes.', 'and I get a', \"and they will issue me a certificate. But before they issue me a certificate like, let's say, this is an email certificate\", 'before they email me a certificate.', 'they will have to validate my email address.', \"And they will validate my email address by sending an email having me click the link or give me a number. And that's it.\", 'So they validated my email address.', 'And therefore now I have a certificate.', \"It's very, very easy. So essentially, anyone with an email can carry email certificate\", 'and you can get it for free as well.', \"Same thing for other certificates as well. So let's say I don't know.\", 'Do you get a Nyu id card anymore?', 'Well, if you do have one.', 'you have to go in person in order to get an Id. They take a picture blah blah.', 'and they validate you are who you are before you get a Id.', \"and this Id has a certificate on it. So essentially, you went to Nyu, and although it's not in the official Ca process, you can think of it as the same thing. You go to Nyu. You go to the office of Ids, and they take your picture. They validate who you are. They look at your passport, or whatever it is that they do, and then they give you your id card. This id card will have a certificate on it\", 'as well. So essentially they validated who you are, and they gave you an id with the certificate inside, and then with the certificate on your Id. You can access various Nyu resources and whatever they have a card reader for it.', \"So it's exactly the same thing. Whenever you go to. Ca, they do some validation of some sort.\", 'and then you get a certificate.', \"Same thing for websites. Right? So let's say you have a website, networksecurityt-shirts.com.\", 'And you want to get a Tls certificate.', 'You go to one of the registers like verisign or something like that semantic.', \"but they don't exist anymore. Geotrust, you go to one of these sources\", 'and you have to prove that you own this website.', 'You have to prove that you own this website.', 'How do you do that?', 'How do you prove that you own a a website?', 'How can you prove to a Ca that you own a website', 'has anyone which got in the Tls certificate before?', \"Yeah, there's 2 different ways.\", \"It's 2 different ways.\", 'The 1st way is uploading some file to the Root Directory.', \"It's not as popular anymore. But that used to be one of the ways.\", 'The second way is to update Dns records.', 'Because if you can update Dns records.', 'you basically, you own the domain.', 'So those are generally the 2 ways that you that you confirm that you own the domain.', 'You put some file on the root or', 'you upload. You update the Dns records of of something.', \"and when you do that you own the domain, and then they'll issue you the certificate. And this certificate is binded\", 'to the website. So the certificate is issued for networksecurityteeshirts.com.', 'So this certificate is for this website issued by the Ca.', 'Certificates come in a format called X, 509, v. 3. But actually, before we go to slides, I just want to show you some real examples. Can someone tell me your favorite website', \"name name a website that you'd like some popular website.\", 'youtube.com.', 'Okay?', 'So', 'one moment I share my screen.', \"Okay? So I'm@youtube.com, and I will now go and look at.\", \"I'll look at the security settings here.\", 'And when I go to the lock, Icon.', 'I can open up this page information.', 'And I see the security information on this website. This is Firefox, by the way.', 'so you go to Firefox. Look at this information.', 'And now you see information about youtube.com.', 'I see that. Oh, well, the connection is encrypted. Trs, Aes. 128 Gcm. Sha-fifty 6, 128 big keys. Trs version 1.3. Then I can take a look at the certificates.', 'When I go to certificates I can see it Tls certificates here.', \"So here's the 1st certificate\", 'and the issuer of the certificate is this one called Wr, 2. So this is the issuer of google.com.', 'And then the issuer of this certificate is Gts root, r. 1.', \"So let's take a look subject name.\", 'The subject name is asterisk.google.com.', \"However, this subject doesn't matter anymore.\", 'Thank you.', 'Thank you for letting me know hold on my share screen did not work.
