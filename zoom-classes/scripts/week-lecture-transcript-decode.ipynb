      "['Hello, welcome to Cs. 6, 8, 2, 3, network security. My name is Professor Philip Mack. Today is Monday, March 17, th 2025.', 'And this is week number 8 for network security. Actually, we are just past the halfway point for network security. So so far, right now, the 1st half of the course we talked about', 'essentially how an attacker can get into a network that is the goal. For the 1st part, we talked about', 'basic security or real security. We talked about all the steps an attacker needs to get into a network', 'reconnaissance to performing scans, finding holes, finding services, finding vulnerabilities, exploiting vulnerabilities getting to a network. And then we talked about basic cryptography.', \"Now we're in the second half of the course, and the second half of the course is\", 'well, a lot of it has to do with protections, defense, and depth. Talking about what ways you can stop an attacker like. Now here, this part of the course I find to be really really interesting, because this is more well, what most of you will probably end up doing unless you become, unless you join a criminal organization.', 'So 1st of all, the', \"post midterm materials, like starting from today onward, this material will be different from the previous half. The course, the 1st thing being that anything on the final exam will be just from this point forward. So you don't have to know the materials from before the midterm exam. Now with that said, you don't have to know anything, but you still have to understand it, and let me give an example. We talked about the fee, Hellman.\", 'and for the midterm exam you were expected to be able to do some divvy Harmon calculations and such.', \"Well, now, for this half of the course. You need to know what Diffie-hellman is, how it works. But you don't need to do any calculations on it. You just have to understand from a high level what you need to do for the V-hellman. But you're not going to get any specific calculation questions as an example.\", \"Right now, 1st of all logistics. Lab 3 has been posted. Lab 3 is on Arp cash poisoning. We're going to talk about that in just a moment, and we'll go over what you need to do to submit. Lab number 3,\", \"lab number 3 is an auto graded assignment. So what this means is that you will be able to submit it as many times as you want, and get your score right away. Lab 3 is the way we're trying to move forward. You will be taking a wire, sharp capture of your work. So you do your work. Do the attack.\", \"and you take a wireshark capture of it, and then you submit the wireshark, and we just look at that wireshark and grade it from there. So it's auto graded, and you get your grade immediately. So please go ahead and try that you should.\", 'You should go ahead and try that as soon as possible.', 'Also, you should have received an email with your mid semester feedback.', 'You probably have gotten multiple reminders about it. I would ask you to do that, and you have some moments to do that in the class later today as well. But if you have a moment, please go ahead, open it, find a link, open it, and think about providing some feedback.', \"and don't forget that next week there is no class. Next week it's spring break.\", 'There is an assignment for you to do if you wish to do it, but nothing will be due during that time. So please, if you are taking a break from school or from work, please go ahead, and I hope you enjoy it.', \"A special note about the final exam. We will have a final exam in May, approximately 2 months from now. I don't remember the date.\", 'and the final exam will be using the responders lockdown browser plus monitor.', \"What this is is that it is some software that's installed on your computer to make sure that you take the test in a secure environment. That is the monitor, your keyboard, your screen, your surroundings, and and your sound.\", 'We will be doing that with the final exam. This requires you to install some software on your computer. And that means you need some administrative rights on your computer to be able to install it.', \"This won't work with Linux, or it won't work with your work, computer or any computer that you don't have administrative rights to.\", \"If for some reason you can't use respondent's lockdown, browser and monitor. Please let me know. We'll take that exam in a alternative way, meaning we go on a zoom. Call together to take the exam.\", \"so we'll get some more information about it as we go along in the semester. But the main point I want to give is that\", 'on the final exam it will be a monitored exam and only approved resources will be allowed. So approved resources would be.', 'course slides, videos, the reading materials from Brightspace. So everything that you have access to on Brightspace, you get access to your textbook. You can bring your own notes as as much notes as you want, but they must be printed out.', \"You'll also get demand pages or manual pages from tools if necessary.\", \"So, for example, on the midterm exam. You were asked about flags, about a tool, and you were able to research it in the final exam. If you get some questions like that, you'll have to look at the man page which would be provided to you if necessary, for you to do any type of work like that.\", 'and there will be no', \"free Internet access meaning you can't just go on any site to do research. You can only use it from approved resources which you'll have a long list of resources. But it won't be free Internet access.\", \"Of course, if you have any questions, please let me know. But you'll be receiving more information and a demo later, this semester. So you have plenty of time to prepare for it.\", \"I want you to get that. You know this in advance. Just so that let's say you are collecting your notes, or the way that you study you write your notes and such. Please make sure that you have in a form that you can print it out, and then you can have it referencing it. So, for example, if you are someone who likes to mark up the slides and whatnot. Please make sure you save a copy of it, and be prepared to\", \"print out a copy for yourself, or something like that. That's how you take notes and such, and you can bring as much notes as you want. But it needs to be physical copy.\", \"You won't be able to access any digital resources\", 'other than the approved resources during your exam. Of course, please reach out to me if you have any questions', 'now, before we continue, I want to talk about Lab 3.', 'So lat. 3 is on arp cache poisoning.', \"So we're going to go over an overview of what arpcache poisoning is, and then we'll talk about some specific protocol level header information on how to actually do it\", 'in Lab 3.', \"For some of you you may recognize that this is a topic from the lab to extra credit, and so, if you did the extra credit, you are one step, one big step ahead already, so we're going to look over some details. And then, if you have any thoughts, please let me know.\", 'So what is art?', 'Arp is a protocol typically used for one computer to find another computer on the local network.', 'Specifically, computers talk to each other on the local network using Mac addresses.', 'But all the addresses that are given to them are in IP addresses.', 'So what they want to know is they want to know which Mac address', 'is associated with what IP address.', \"That's the goal for an Arp function.\", 'So here we have an example on the slide.', \"We have this computer over here. And let's say, this computer is B, this computer is B,\", 'and B is looking for 10 dot, one dot, one dot 4.', \"So what B does is that it sends out a broadcast. Arp request message, and it's broadcast.\", 'Our request message says, who has 1 0 dot one dot one dot 4.', 'Please tell me, IM 1 0 dot one dot, one dot, 2 Mac address B,', 'and it sends this information out to the entire network as a broadcast.', 'Now in Arp, when they do a broadcast. The technical term is gratuitous.', \"So it's sending a gratuitous Arp request message out to the entire network.\", 'And this message says, who has 1 0 dot one dot, one dot 4.', 'Please tell me.', 'IM, 1 0 dot one dot, one dot, 2 Mac address B, and it sends it out to everyone on the network', 'as a broadcast.', \"and then the correct host comes back. So let's say we have this host over here. This host is Mac. Address A,\", 'and A says,', \"I'm the one they're looking for. So it sends back a unicast message. So unicast is a fancy way to say point to point.\", \"It's sending a unicast message over back to B. And it says, Hello, I am\", 'IP. 10. Dot one dot one dot 4,', 'and my Mac address is A, and it sends this information back to B.', 'And now B has updated its arpcache.', 'This is a normal functioning Arp request and an Arp reply.', 'In lab 2.', 'There was one question about IP. 1, 0, dot 9 dot 0 dot 9, 9 or something along that lines. And they asked.', \"Why doesn't that work.\", 'and this is the reason why here, as explained here. So your host, the attacker, tries to ping 1 0 dot 9 dot 0 dot 9 9,', 'but it sends an Arp request out, excuse me a gratuitous arp request out, and it gets no response.', 'So if you did the extra credit portion for Lab 2. You would have had to make that reply in order for it to work in one way or another. You had to make that reply.', 'There was more than one way to solve the solve through the extra credit.', 'Now the thing is when they send out that information.', 'When B sends out that information.', 'Everyone has that information as well. So, for example, for example.', \"let's say this host over here.\", 'and it says it sends a gratuitous Arp reply.', 'which says, Hello, everyone. I am 10 dot one dot one dot one.', 'My Mac address is a and if it sends it out to everyone.', 'Everyone knows this information now. Everyone knows this information now, and in the old days', 'this used to be a major vulnerability in old days, I mean, like, 10 years ago', \"this used to be a major major vulnerability, and all the operating systems will update the Arp cache to say, okay. So you say that you're 10 dot one dot, one dot, one Mac, address a. Let me just update my arp cache\", 'to say that you are 10 dot one dot one dot, one Mac address a.', 'This was such a big vulnerability that', 'all operating systems has basically been patched', 'to not do this anymore. So gratuitous art reply', 'does not work anymore. Now, if you go online and you do some research on art, gratuitous art reply, you may see some like a task that says, Oh, this works. This is a way to do it. So easy. Yeah, yeah.', 'this was so easy. This was a big, big vulnerability like 10 years ago.', \"Today, this doesn't work anymore at all at all.\", \"So what the goal is, let's say, here is the attacker.\", \"The attacker would like to perform a fake update on everyone's arpcache.\", 'They want to do a fake update', \"on everyone's art cache so that when they try to reach the the\", \"the IP address, they're going to the wrong Mac address.\", \"So that's the goal here, and in general there are 4 ways to do our cache poisoning.\", 'The 4 ways are gratuitous art request', \"and unicast art reply. So there's 2 of them that are in green\", 'or normal. This is a normal normal art request and art reply process. This is what you see. If you took a wireshark off your network, you see this', 'a million times a day. A gratuitous art reply, a unicast Arp.', 'Excuse me, introduce this art request and a unicast art reply.', \"Then we have this gratuitous art reply. That's the one we just talked about a moment ago.\", \"And this one doesn't work doesn't work at all.\", 'I mean.', \"potentially, maybe if you have a device like an IoT device that hasn't been updated in a decade. Maybe it'll work on it.\", \"But otherwise it doesn't work anymore, because it was such a big problem.\", 'And then we have this weird thing called a unicast arp request.', 'So a Arp request is normally gratuitous, which which means broadcast.', \"But you can also send a unicast arp request as well. It's not normal. But it's fine.\", \"right? It's fine.\", 'So what you need to do on your lab assignment.', 'The 1st thing on your lab assignment to do is that you have to figure out', 'which of these methods will work', 'on the seed lapse. That is, which of these methods will work on ubuntu', \"to perform an arpcache poisoning, that is, you're doing a fake arpcache update and which ones don't work.\", \"So that's the 1st task for your assignment.\", 'Which of these work? And which of these? Not? I can tell you right now', \"that this one doesn't work.\", \"and you're not even going to try it in your assignment. So in your assignment. You'll be trying these other 3 methods.\", \"and you'd be determining whether they work to perform arpcache poisoning\", 'or not work to perform our cache reasoning, and', 'in which conditions do they work.', \"or in which conditions they don't work.\", 'So that is your 1st task here, and for this task', 'you have to make sure you do it correctly, because the other task on Lab 3', \"depend on this as well. So make sure you do this correctly before you move on like, don't move on until you really understand. Task one.\", 'Here is what a arp request and reply header looks like.', 'and I want to point out something here.', \"you notice, like, let's say, on this left slide, on this left side of the of the slide. It's a Arp request message.\", 'And do you notice that the Art Request message', 'has the source. IP source, Mac address and the destination. Mac, address 2 times in the header.', \"Do you see what I'm what I'm talking about.\", \"Do you see that there is a destination and source Mac address that's on both?\", \"That's on 2 times in the header.\", 'Does anyone know why that is like that', 'like, why is it twice in there', 'anyone have any ideas', \"like here it is. Here's the destination, Mac address.\", \"And here is the target, Mac, address? Right? It's twice.\", 'And then here is the source, Mac address.', \"And here's the sender, Mac address. So it's sent twice.\", 'Yeah, yeah. Because of the Osi model.', 'The information is sent multiple times.', \"So the Internet header, that's layer 2,\", \"that's that's layer 2 and the arch header. That's\", 'oh, what is that? Is that layer? 2 or layer? 3. I.', \"It's very confusing, right? Because it's the bridging between layer 2 and layer 3.\", 'So on the 1st header, the Ethernet header, on the top.', 'This is clearly layer 2, and the Ethernet header is what takes a pack, a frame from one host to another host.', 'So this frame it gets sent to', 'the destination, and then the operating system strips off the the Arp header. Excuse me, strips off the Ethernet header.', 'and then they process the arp. Then they process the Arp header.', \"So this is how well, that's how all network packets work. There's multiple layers in it, and sometimes some of the information is duplicated as well.\", \"We're going to talk about several other protocols that work exactly the same way here.\", \"So the 1st header on top is the Ethernet header. That's the layer, 2 header.\", \"and the next header is the arp header. That's the layer, 2 or 3 2 slash 3 header, and you see that it has the information up ahead, because the arp header\", \"it's processed by a different\", 'process than the Ethernet header. So once the frame gets to the target, the Ethernet header is read by the operating system and is discarded.', 'and then the art header only goes up to the up to the next layer to process.', 'So this gives some really really interesting things, like, for example.', \"this information is supposed to match each other, but it doesn't have to right they. They are expected\", 'to match each other.', \"But actually they don't absolutely need to do that.\", 'So strangely like, for example.', \"this this Ethernet header has a broadcast destination, Mac address. So it's a broadcast, gratuitous. But the target, Mac address over here.\", \"It doesn't need to be the same.\", \"because they can't see each other.\", 'They can see each other so it could be different.', 'And potentially, you can exploit this', 'this difference here. You can do it in your lab in your lab. 3 as well.', \"But here's what an arp request and reply looks like. So 1st you have the Ethernet header, and the Ethernet header is very simple. It has a destination and source, Mac address, and that's it.\", 'And then you have the arp header', \"and the arp header says, Oh, this is an Arp request. Here's the sender, Mac address. Here's the sender IP address. Here's the target, Mac address and the target IP address.\", 'and what this one is saying is', 'this, Arp request is saying is, Hello.', 'I am Mac a Ipa, and I am looking for', 'this IP address. I am looking for which Mac address has', 'is associated with this IP address.', 'So this is the Arp request for a Mac address.', \"And here, look in this art reply on the right side as an Ethernet header, so Ethernet header is destination and source. So destination is what's supposed to be unicast. So it's a Mac address, but it can also be gratuitous and have a Rf's as well.\", 'And then the source Mac address', \"type reply, and it says Sender's Mac address is B. Sender's IP address is B.\", 'So this is Imb, Mac, IMPI. P.', 'And I am sending this information over to Target Maca, Ipa. So this is a response back to a saying.', \"I am the IP address that you're looking for, and here's my Mac address.\", 'So this is an Arp request and an Arp reply.', 'I understand, if this can be confusing, this could be very confusing, I understand.', 'So to perform arpcache poisoning. There are lots and lots of tools to do it.', \"Does anyone have a favorite tool for doing arpcache poisoning? If this is something that you've done before.\", \"maybe you've performed a pen test using arpcache poisoning.\", 'My favorite one is Eta Cap.', 'and that comes with my favorite one. It works really well.', 'The Command line version works really well.', 'The Gui version is little shaky buggy.', 'but the Command line version works really really well. So there are lots of tools that you can do, just lots and lots of tools online.', \"But for you, you'll be doing in Scapi. You can look up some sample code online. It's extremely easy to do arpcache poisoning. We've got lots of samples and resources that you can use to help you with it.\", 'But I want to show it in action. So this diagram shows a normal typical network.', 'Here you have a switch. You have a router over here.', 'You have a switch, and you have Mac computer B over here', 'and over here. You have Attacker.', \"This attacker wants to become the attacker in the middle. In other words, man in the middle. But we use the term attacker in the middle, because it's a much better term.\", 'So this attacker wants to be the attacker in the middle aitm.', 'and in order to get in between this router and the host.', \"They're going to do arc cache poisoning on both of these hosts.

It sent an Arp message to the router, and it says, Router.\", 'the Mac address for 1 0 dot one dot, one dot 2 has been updated to C,', 'and that sends a message to the target.', '10 dot, one dot, one dot, 2,', 'and it says, you want to talk to the router. You want to talk to 10 dot one dot, one dot one.', 'Its Mac address is C, and so now.', 'when they try to talk to each other.', 'when B tries to talk to A, so B is trying to go to 10 dot, one dot, one dot one. It actually goes to Mac, address C,', 'and when the router over here it wants to talk to 1 0 dot one dot one dot 2. It will go to Mac. Address C,', 'and the attacker here will bridge disconnection between them.', \"That's IP forward. I think you did download your lab assignments already. That's IP forwarding. So it doesn't IP forward between these 2 hosts, and it is now the attacker in the middle, and can see all of this data. Now\", 'was that clear?', 'Should I go over it one more time.', 'the attacker, the attacker wants to poison the cache', 'arp cache for both A and B,', 'and it pointed to the Arp cache', \"by changing the IP. The Mac address associated with the IP address. So it's our cache here for 10.\", 'This arpcache over here for 11 dot, one dot, 2, says B.', 'What the attacker wants to do is change his Arp cache', 'for IP 10 dot one dot, one dot, 2 to BC, so it sends an attack', 'over to the switch and to the router. It says, well, 11 dot, one dot 2', 'is now at Max C. The attacker.', 'and it does the same thing over to Target B. It says, Hey, B.', 'You want to talk to the router, which is at 10 dot one dot one dot one.', 'Its Mac address is now at C.', 'So now the attacker gets to see all the traffic and be the middle of the traffic.', \"and then when they're done.\", \"and then when they're done, they'll try to clean everything up.

Sends a message to B. It says, Hey, B.', 'You want to talk to 1 0 dot one dot, one dot one the router.

It doesn't know. It doesn't understand what an IP address is, so it doesn't matter for the switch. But the router over here a router by definition is a layer. 3. Device, and this layer 3. Device has the Arp cache.\", 'so it has an Arp cache, and', 'anything else that talks in layer 3 has an Arp cache as well, so the router', 'and the host, so the attacker is exploiting both the router', 'host B over here in order to perform this attack.', 'and the thing is, you must do it in both sides.', 'So for Lab 2, many of you who did Arpcache poisoning did not do the complete loop', 'between them.

Remember in Dns. If the example we used was in a cafe, you're sitting in a Starbucks. Everyone has access to everyone's\", 'information.', 'Why?', 'Well, I guess', \"this bridges to this, because the arpcache poisoning is one of the ways in which someone at Starbucks has access to all your information.
