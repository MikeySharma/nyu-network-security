Can you hear me.', 'Yes.', \"Oh, yeah. So from my understanding. Like you said earlier. Trudy can see it, but as long as she can't modify it, then she cannot conduct like any sort of attack. So when you\", 'so they need to be protected. Gn, a and B, they need to be protected in the way that they are assigned, that, like both sides of like, whoever is communicating can verify that these values are', \"are valid, but in terms of encryption.

And B', 'only needs to be protected from modification, because, just by viewing it.', '2D.

And so Alice is actually talking to Trudy, pretending to be Bob.', 'and then Trudy goes ahead and pretends to be Alice, and then talks to Bob and generates another session.

They use pki.', 'they are. They use topic certificates.', \"And then hmac is symmetric, which means it's the same key to encrypt and decrypt\", \"in this example. Here they're using an Hmac. So it's a symmetric key. But it doesn't matter at all whatsoever.\", 'So in this scenario, actually.', \"you have to explain this scenario to me because I never, never understood this slide. I'm going to have to update the slide in the future. So\", 'Alice is transferring 1 million dollars from Bill to Trudy or whatever, and sending it to the bank.', 'Judy goes ahead and records the conversation and replays it.', 'and she sends the same message over to Bob again, and then the money gets transferred again.', \"whatever it's a replay attack.\", 'So when something is digitally signed.', 'they get the jury signed forever.

So once a website certificate is signed by the Ca.\", \"it's forever signed by the Ca, it.\", \"you can't unsign it. That's why there are certificate, verification lists, crls, and other methods.
