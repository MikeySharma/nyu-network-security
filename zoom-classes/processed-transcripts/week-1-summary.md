* Midterm Exam: Saturday, March 15th (10 AM - 12 PM)
* Spring Break: Week of March 24th (no class)
* Final Exam: Saturday, May 10th (10 AM - 12 PM)

**6.  Academic Honesty and Generative AI:**

* Three-strike policy for academic dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism).
* Generative AI (ChatGPT, etc.) encouraged for learning but strictly prohibited for exams and submitting work.
    * Students are responsible for ensuring submitted work does not contain plagiarism, even if generated by AI.

**7. Weekly Exercises:**

* Short, weekly assignments for participation points (2% total).
* Due by 2 PM the following Monday.

**8. Seed Labs Setup:**

* **VirtualBox:** Recommended for newer computers (last 6 years).
* **VMware Workstation:** Required for Apple Silicon Macs (M-series).
* **Cloud Options:** DigitalOcean (recommended for beginners, $200 credit via GitHub Student Developer Pack), Microsoft Azure ($100 credit for NYU students).

**9. Introduction to Network Security:**

* Focus on preventing undesired behaviors and addressing edge cases.
* Importance of understanding system vulnerabilities and the cost of defense.
* Increasing complexity of network security due to factors like teleworking and interconnected systems.

**10. Lab Assignment 1 - Concepts Guide:**

* **Task 1:** TCP SYN Flood Attack (and mitigation using SYN cookies).
* **Task 2:** TCP Reset Attack (with bonus for automation).
* **Task 3:** TCP Session Hijacking.
* **Task 4:** Reverse Shell.

**11. TCP SYN Flood Attack (Detailed Explanation):**

* **TCP Three-Way Handshake:**
    1. Client sends SYN packet (40 bytes: 20-byte IP header + 20-byte TCP header).
    2. Server sends SYN-ACK packet.
    3. Client sends ACK packet.
* **SYN Flood Attack:** Attacker floods the server with SYN packets, causing the server to allocate resources for each request, eventually exhausting resources and preventing legitimate connections.
* **Mitigation with SYN Cookies:** Server sends a specially crafted sequence number (SYN cookie) in the SYN-ACK.  The server only allocates resources if the client returns the correct ACK containing the SYN cookie. This prevents resource exhaustion during a SYN flood attack.

**12. TCP Reset Attack (Detailed Explanation):**

* Attacker injects a TCP RST packet into an established TCP connection, causing the connection to terminate.
* Requires correct sequence and acknowledgment numbers to be effective.
* **Lab Task:** Sniff the network traffic (using Wireshark) to obtain the sequence and acknowledgment numbers, then craft and send the RST packet to break the connection.
* **Bonus:** Automate the process of sniffing and injecting the RST packet.

### Final Takeaways:

* Network security requires a different mindset than other computer science disciplines, focusing on preventing undesired behaviors.
* The interconnected nature of systems increases complexity and vulnerabilities.
* Practical skills like sniffing network traffic, crafting packets, and using tools like Wireshark are crucial for network security analysis and defense.

**Follow-up Actions:**

* Set up Seed Labs environment (local or cloud).
* Start working on Lab 1 and Homework 1.
* Join Slack and introduce yourself.
* Review networking and programming concepts if needed.
